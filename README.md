# clarity-basic-vote
Basic smart contract to vote for 2 candidates.

## Modifications to original contract
* Added posibility to close and re-open the vote
* Added paying for voting (in the future a token could be created for this sole purpose).

[check_winner.py](check_winner.py) uses stack's API to check who is winning the election.
